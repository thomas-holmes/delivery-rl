# THE GAME

Dragon Pizza Delivery (name pending)

You're trying to delivery pizza (maybe other foods?) to a dragon in cave.

You have to get it past the various challenges that are in the dragon's cave. Probably:
* Bandits
* Goblins/Goblins/Trolls/Ogres
* Wild Animals
* Unscrupulous Adventurers

Food clock would be the temperature of the food item to be delivered. Find ways to warm/chill the item to extend hunger clock.

Score could probably be your tip based on turns/time/temp.

Maybe have it be close to coffee break roguelike in duration 15~30 minutes expected completion time.

"Classes" could depend on the food item, or perhaps you just select a delivery approach (sneaky, bruiser, trickster)

Is the character an adventurer? Or just a really amazing, the best ever, delivery person. I'm leaning towards the latter with a bunch of delivery themed abilities, primarily no killing.
