# DeliveryRL

The ancient dragon is hungry and you're short on time. You have better deliver that pizza quickly!

## Compilation

To compile/run you will need sdl2, sdl_ttf, and gcc/mingw

The sdl2 bindings are vendored but you will still need to ensure that the shared libraries are installed and available on your system. Go to [veandco/go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) and follow the SDL installation instructions for your platform.

To build, change to the run_dir director and build the game with `go build github.com/thomas-holmes/delivery-rl/game` and then run game.exe

## Disclaimers

This is pre-alpha software!
