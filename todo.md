### Game
Save the game & optionally resume?
Restart after death
Change the seed
Move content (monster, items, spells, etc...) definitions out of code?

### Dungeon
Dungeon should instead be caves for a dragon. Maybe we have multiple customers, some go to caves, some dungeons, etc...
Spawn random monsters

### Monsters
Drop loot

### Items/Equipment
- Player
  - Shoes
  - Distraction Items (Flashlight?)
  - Smoke Bombs?
- Monsters/Creatures
  - Armour
  - Clubs/Swords
  - Natural Weapons (Teeth/Claws)
- Consumables
  - Heat packs (Warm the pizza)
  - Lost adventuring gear (wands/potions?)

### Player
Superb Delivery Person, not a real fighter
- Focus on mobility, evasion, distraction tactics.
- Stamina for sprinting and performing evasive maneuvers instead of MP?

### Combat
Do when the player has more stuff, armour, stats, etc... integrate this into combat

### Magic
Some creatures may have magic but the player might not exactly. Maybe some player choices could have some magic abilities? Maybe all delivery people are not mundane.

### Interface
Inspect mode should either move the camera or not go beyond the bounds of the cameraa


You're trying to delivery pizza (maybe other foods?) to a dragon in cave.

You have to get it past the various challenges that are in the dragon's cave. Probably:
* Bandits
* Goblins/Goblins/Trolls/Ogres
* Wild Animals
* Unscrupulous Adventurers

Food clock would be the temperature of the food item to be delivered. Find ways to warm/chill the item to extend hunger clock.

Score could probably be your tip based on turns/time/temp.

Maybe have it be close to coffee break roguelike in duration 15~30 minutes expected completion time.

"Classes" could depend on the food item, or perhaps you just select a delivery approach (sneaky, bruiser, trickster)

Is the character an adventurer? Or just a really amazing, the best ever, delivery person. I'm leaning towards the latter with a bunch of delivery themed abilities, primarily no killing.
