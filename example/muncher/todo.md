### Game
Save the game & optionally resume?
Restart after death
Change the seed
Move content (monster, items, spells, etc...) definitions out of code?
Update input handling to deal w/ modifier keys

### Dungeon
Generate more levels
Spawn random monsters
Drop loot?

### Monsters
With a several monsters should not try to yield its turn, it should instead try to take an alternative route. (This is currently a panic condition)

### Game Loop
Maybe move more of the game loop into World.Update, specifically the input

### Equipment
More slots, armour, rings, etc...

### Player
Add attributes/stats

### Combat
Do when the player has more stuff, armour, stats, etc... integrate this into combat

### Magic
You know, fireball!

### Interface
Inspect mode would be good. X and target over square, get info? Inspect would be useful for debugging things like vision/scent?
