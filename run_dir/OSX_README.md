# OSX

If you've downloaded the OSX package, you will need to install sdl2 and sdl2_image if you don't already have them installed.
```
brew install sdl2{,_image,} pkg-config
```
Then you can directly run `delivery-rl.sh`. If you can't get that to work, or you have downloaded the windows+linux archive you can run the windows version with wine.
