# Game Design
Musing and recording various game design elements.

### Reality
"Dragon" randomly placed on bottom level.
Reach the dragon to win the game

### Theme
You're trying to delivery pizza (maybe other foods?) to a dragon in cave.

You have to get it past the various challenges that are in the dragon's cave. Probably:
- Bandits
- Goblins/Goblins/Trolls/Ogres
- Wild Animals
- Unscrupulous Adventurers

Food clock would be the temperature of the food item to be delivered. Find ways to warm/chill the item to extend hunger clock.

Score could probably be your tip based on turns/time/temp.

Maybe have it be close to coffee break roguelike in duration 15~30 minutes expected completion time.

"Classes" could depend on the food item, or perhaps you just select a delivery approach (sneaky, bruiser, trickster)

Is the character an adventurer? Or just a really amazing, the best ever, delivery person. I'm leaning towards the latter with a bunch of delivery themed abilities, primarily no killing.

Maybe some kind of meta progression or meta flavor?
 - Regenerate seen levels w/ player ghosts
 - Easter Eggs from previous runs. (Maybe a creature has stolen your gear and is using it?)
 - In game text? Hinting at a previously seen level/past delivery characters when something happens.


### Dungeon
Dungeon should instead be caves for a dragon. Maybe we have multiple customers, some go to caves, some dungeons, etc...

Lots of small levels?
Fewer big levels?
Maybe a few big levels with lots of dead end levels?
Maybe branches add complexity

### Items/Equipment
- Player
  - Shoes
  - Distraction Items (Flashlight?)
  - Smoke Bombs?
- Monsters/Creatures
  - Armour
  - Clubs/Swords
  - Natural Weapons (Teeth/Claws)
- Consumables
  - Heat packs (Warm the pizza)
  - Lost adventuring gear (wands/potions?)

### Player
Superb Delivery Person, not a real fighter
- Focus on mobility, evasion, distraction tactics.
- Stamina for sprinting and performing evasive maneuvers instead of MP?
- Maybe some characters are of races/species that have some magic abilities?

### Magic
Some creatures may have magic but the player might not exactly. Maybe some player choices could have some magic abilities? Maybe all delivery people are not mundane.
